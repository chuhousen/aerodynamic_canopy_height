# Aerodynamic canopy height
This repository provides the R codes and results of the calculation of aerodynamic canopy height (*ha*) for the manuscript *"Temporal dynamics of aerodynamic canopy height derived from eddy covariance momentum data collected across North American Flux Networks"* by Housen Chu et al.  Briefly, the /R folder contains the R codes/functions used for calculation of *ha*. The /demo folder show two workflow examples for calculating *ha* at a forest site (estimate at a annual time step) and a cropland site (estimate at a weekly time step). Its subfolders /demo/input and /demo/output provide example files of the calculation input and output. The /data folder contains all calculated *ha* (68 forest sites, annual estimates for ~480 site-years; 23 cropland/grassland sites, weekly estimates for ~94 site-years) that are used in the manuscript.
