# Aerodynamic canopy height
This repository provides the R codes and results of the calculation of aerodynamic canopy height (*ha*) for the paper *"Temporal Dynamics of Aerodynamic Canopy Height Derived From Eddy Covariance Momentum Flux Data Across North American Flux Networks"* by Housen Chu et al. published in 2018 in Geophysical Research Letters < https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL079306>.   

Briefly, the /R folder contains the R codes/functions used for calculation of *ha*. 
The /demo folder show two workflow examples for calculating *ha* at a forest site (estimate at a annual time step) and a cropland site (estimate at a weekly time step). Its subfolders /demo/input and /demo/output provide example files of the calculation input and output. 
The /data folder contains all calculated *ha* (69 forest sites, annual estimates for ~480 site-years; 23 cropland/grassland sites, weekly estimates for ~94 site-years) that are used in the study.
